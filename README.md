## ðŸ‘‹ A place where VEEB Projects shares some things.

Also, have a look at our:

- [![YouTube Channel Views]("https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/views/UCz5BOU9J9pB_O0B8-rDjCWQ?style=flat&logo=youtube&logoColor=red&labelColor=white&color=ffed53")](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz5BOU9J9pB_O0B8-rDjCWQ),
- [diary](https://veeb.ch/projects) where we write succinct summaries of what we're up to,
- occasional ramblings on <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@veeb">Mastodon</a>.


 
or chat to us in real time on:

- [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?nick=LotOfFroth%3F#veeb) (#veeb on irc.libera.chat).

Our insistence on using a chat service from the 1980s means that it gets a bit quiet. It would be delightful if you stopped by.
