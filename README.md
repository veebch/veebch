## ðŸ‘‹ This is a place where VEEB Projects shares some of the things that we've made.

Also, have a look at our

- Videos [![YouTube Channel Views](https://img.shields.io/youtube/channel/views/UCz5BOU9J9pB_O0B8-rDjCWQ?label=YouTube&style=social)](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCz5BOU9J9pB_O0B8-rDjCWQ) (views, not subscribers, that would be silly),
- [Diary](https://veeb.ch/projects) - where we write overly short summaries of what we're up to,
- <a rel="me" href="https://fosstodon.org/@veeb">Mastodon</a> - where we post the occasional update.

or chat to us in real time on

- [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?nick=LotOfFroth%3F#veeb) (#veeb on irc.libera.chat).

It would be delightful if you stopped by.
